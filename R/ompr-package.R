#' A package to Model (Mixed) Integer Programs
#'
#' A package to model (mixed) integer programs.
#' It provides an algebraic way to model mixed integer linear
#' optimization problems directly in R.
#' The model is solver-independent and thus offers the possiblity
#' to solve a model with different solvers. See the ompr
#' website for more information, documentation and examples.

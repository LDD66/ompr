Description: A package to model (mixed) integer programs.
             It provides an algebraic way to model mixed integer linear
             optimization problems directly in R.
             The model is solver-independent and thus offers the possiblity
             to solve a model with different solvers. See the ompr
             website for more information, documentation and examples.
